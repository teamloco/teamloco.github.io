              We were inspired to build Loco after The New York Times wrote this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html">piece</a>.
              We've all been there, waiting, patience wearing thin as the train we needed seems to have gotten lost. You begin to wonder if you could make it to another station and try a different route.
              But what if the train comes right after you leave? So you wait, hoping for some announcement to let you know what's happening. Well, we got tired of waiting, and we now know that announcement is never going to come. 
              Instead, we saw an opportunity to connect people with the amazing people around them, so we took it.

              New York City is a magical place, the best city in the world, a global landmark of wealth and opportunity. Unfortunately, we are plagued with one of the <em>worst</em> transit authorities in the world. A large part of our roadmap is
              the ability to provide the MTA with statistics identifying problem areas. What better source than the people who are riding the MTA? With our data, user complaints could be modeled into usable data to help the MTA
              build a more efficient system. Oh, and don't worry about your personal information. We don't track who makes the complaints, just that a complaint was made.
